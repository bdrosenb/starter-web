Oh, I'm sorry, I forgotâ€¦ your wife is dead! What is she doing at a beauty pageant? Is she running the lights or something? This is not what it looks like. It looks like you're tweaking her nipples through a chain-link fence. I'm in Vegas this week and would like to point out the Blue Man Group is *actually* hiring. The support group? You're blowing my mind, Frank.
